# MEMORANSOME GAME

## Description

Memoransome is a simple memory game conceived and built by Kevin Uti, primarily to demonstrate his javascript skill.
Playing Memoransome boils down to paying attention to the randomly selected boxes and repeating the pattern in the same order.
In each stage of Memoransome, there are five substages with equal difficulty. The progress in a stage is indicated by the yellow 
balls below the board. To get the task for the current substage, click on the blinking ball. Once the five substages have been completed,
you are promoted to the next level(and of course with higher difficulty).
For each miss, you lose a brain cell. The game is over when you have no brain cells left.

### NB: Main purpose of project is to demontrate javascript skills hence, it's not mobile combatible.
